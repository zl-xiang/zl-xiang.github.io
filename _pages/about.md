I believe establishing provable correspondences between **logical representations (reasoning)** and **neural models (learning)** could be an effective approach to address  **human-level intelligence**, therefore I am keen to explore both **knowledge representation and reasoning** and **machine learning**, and their **integration**, in particular, **Neuro-symbolic Reasoning**, **Knowledge Representation and Reasoning**, **Logic Programming** and **Representation Learning**, **Natural Language Processing**.
