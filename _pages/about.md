Having studied in a major with strong mathematical background equipped me with **maturity in mathematics**, 5 years of industrial experience enhanced my **hands-on ability in programming**, being emphasised in AI modules during MSc study provided me with solid foundation in both **theoretical** and **practical** aspects of **AI**. I believe that establishing provable correspondences between **logical representations (reasoning)** and **neural models (learning)** could be an effective approach to address  **human-level intelligence**, therefore I am keen to explore both **knowledge representation and reasoning** and **machine learning**, and their **integration**, in particular, **Neuro-symbolic AI**, **Logic Programming** and **Representation Learning**.
