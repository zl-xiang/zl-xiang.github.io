I believe intelligent systems should be rooted in *sound theory* and developed through rigorous methods, in order to serve as *controllable* and *responsible* technology. I am keen to deepen my *theoretical understanding* of the integration of **Learning and Reasoning**, and to translate this understanding into *practical solutions*. In particular, I am interested in **logic-based approaches to learning**, **learning structured representations**, and principled **handling of imperfect data** and **data quality management** in intelligent systems.


Please see my [**CV**](https://zl-xiang.github.io/files/Zhiliang_CV.pdf) for more details.
