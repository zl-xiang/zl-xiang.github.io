I believe establishing provable correspondences between **logical representations (reasoning)** and **neural models (learning)** could be an effective approach to address  **human-level intelligence**, therefore I am keen to explore both **Knowledge Representation and Reasoning** and **Machine Learning**, and their **integration**, in particular, **Neuro-symbolic Reasoning**, **Knowledge Representation and Reasoning**, **Logic Programming** and **Representation Learning**, **Knowledge-based NLP**.
